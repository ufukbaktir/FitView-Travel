# FitView-Travel
"FitView Travel" is a web application that allows users to track their health data and also experience a virtual travel around the world. Using this application created with Vue.js, you will be able to receive health data from Google Fit and view this data on an activity profile. The app provides navigation on StreetView via Google Maps and StreetView APIs. Users can take a virtual walk anywhere in the world using the app. The app also provides a real-time fitness experience with real-time data taken from the smart wristband.
